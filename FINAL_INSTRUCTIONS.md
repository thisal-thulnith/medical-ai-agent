### ✅ STEP 2: Paste Your API Key

**Open this file in your editor:**
```
/Users/thisalthulnith/medicalagent/backend/.env
```

**Find line 2 and replace it:**
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-key-here
```

**SAVE THE FILE!**

---

### ✅ STEP 3: Run the Application

**Option A: Automatic (Easiest)**
```bash
cd /Users/thisalthulnith/medicalagent
./RUN_ME.sh
```

**Option B: Manual (2 terminals)**

Terminal 1 - Backend:
```bash
cd /Users/thisalthulnith/medicalagent/backend
source venv/bin/activate
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Terminal 2 - Frontend:
```bash
cd /Users/thisalthulnith/medicalagent/frontend
npm run dev
```
