## 🚀 How to Use the APIs

### Method 1: Through Chat Interface

Just ask the AI naturally:

- **"Is it safe for me to take Aspirin?"**
  → AI fetches FDA info, checks your allergies & conditions

- **"What medications can I take for headache?"**
  → AI searches ICD-10 codes + medical literature

- **"Check if my medications interact"**
  → AI uses RxNorm interaction API

- **"What's the latest research on diabetes?"**
  → AI searches PubMed

### Method 2: Direct API Testing

Run the test script:
```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
python test_free_apis.py
```

### Method 3: API Endpoints

The backend exposes these through the chat agent automatically. When users ask medication questions, the AI agent calls these APIs behind the scenes.

## 🔬 Advanced Features We Built

### 1. Comprehensive Medication Safety Analysis
Combines multiple APIs to check:
- ✅ User allergies vs active ingredients
- ✅ User medical conditions vs drug warnings
- ✅ Drug interactions with current medications
- ✅ FDA safety information
- ✅ Safety score (SAFE / CAUTION / HIGH_RISK)

**Code:**
```python
safety = await api_service.analyze_medication_safety(
    drug_name="Aspirin",
    user_allergies=["Penicillin"],
    user_conditions=["Diabetes", "Hypertension"]
)
```

### 2. Drug Suggestions by Condition
Combines ICD-10 + PubMed:
```python
suggestions = await api_service.get_drug_suggestions("headache")
# Returns: ICD-10 codes, research articles, treatment info
```

### 3. Differential Diagnosis
Uses symptoms + medical literature:
- Searches PubMed for similar cases
- Maps symptoms to ICD-10 codes
- Provides evidence-based differential diagnoses

---

## 💡 How the AI Agent Uses These APIs

When you chat with the AI, it automatically:

1. **Classifies your intent**
   - Medication query? → Calls medication agent
   - Diagnosis question? → Calls diagnosis agent
   - Report analysis? → Calls report agent

2. **Medication Agent**
   - Extracts drug name from your message
   - Calls OpenFDA for drug info
   - Calls RxNorm for standard names
   - Checks your allergies & conditions
   - Generates personalized safety analysis

3. **Diagnosis Agent**
   - Extracts symptoms from conversation
   - Searches PubMed for relevant research
   - Gets ICD-10 codes for conditions
   - Performs differential diagnosis
   - Explains in simple language

## 🎓 Example Conversations

### Example 1: Medication Safety Check
```
You: "Can I take Ibuprofen? I'm allergic to aspirin"

AI:
✅ Analyzing Ibuprofen safety for you...

Drug Information (OpenFDA):
- Generic Name: Ibuprofen
- Purpose: Pain reliever and fever reducer (NSAID)

⚠️ SAFETY ALERT:
You have an aspirin allergy. Ibuprofen is also an NSAID and
may cause similar reactions. Cross-reactivity risk: 10-15%.

Recommendation:
⚠️ CAUTION - Consult your doctor before use. Alternative:
Consider acetaminophen (Tylenol) which is not an NSAID.

Recent Research (PubMed):
- Study: "Cross-reactivity of NSAIDs in aspirin-sensitive patients"
- URL: [pubmed link]
```

### Example 2: Symptom Diagnosis
```
You: "I have headache, fever, and body aches"

AI:
🔬 Analyzing your symptoms...

Differential Diagnosis:
1. **Viral Infection (Most Likely)**
   - ICD-10: J11.1 (Influenza with respiratory manifestations)
   - Matches: fever, body aches, headache
   - Typical duration: 3-7 days

2. **Bacterial Infection (Consider)**
   - ICD-10: J20.9 (Acute bronchitis)
   - May need antibiotics if persists >7 days

3. **COVID-19 (Rule Out)**
   - Similar presentation
   - Recommend: At-home test

Recent Research (PubMed):
- "Symptomatic treatment of viral infections" (2025)
- "Differentiation of viral vs bacterial illness"

Recommendations:
✅ Rest and hydration
✅ Acetaminophen for fever/aches
⚠️ See doctor if: fever >3 days, difficulty breathing
🏥 ER if: severe headache, confusion, chest pain
```
